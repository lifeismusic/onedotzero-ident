/**
 * Tile based frame exporter for saving super high resolution images, based on
 * code by Marius Watz. This is a simplified version and adds support for
 * different view angles (FOV) and clipping planes. Based on the number of tiles
 * used each frame will be rendered in slices several times and the main
 * application must ensure that no parameters are changed during this process as
 * else visible seams will appear in the exported image. The resulting image
 * size is numTiles the size of the current window size. The individual
 * slices/tiles are stitched together in a large offscreen buffer. The maximum
 * image size depends on the available RAM and it's the user's responsibility to
 * ensure enough memory is available.
